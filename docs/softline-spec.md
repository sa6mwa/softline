# softline Current State And Readline Gap Spec

## Purpose

softline is a small C89/POSIX prompt editor for multiline command entry. Its
current center of gravity is shells, REPLs, chat prompts, and terminal tools
where `Enter` submits the current buffer and `Ctrl-J` inserts a literal newline.

softline is not currently a complete GNU Readline replacement. It is a
handle-owned editor core with enough terminal rendering, history, key binding,
and native chat support to build multiline readline-like interfaces without
global editor state.

## Current Public Shape

The public API is the installed header `include/softline/softline.h`.

- `sl_t` is a receiver-style handle. Constructors return a handle with method
  pointers plus an opaque implementation pointer.
- `sl_create()` creates a handle with default configuration.
- `sl_create_with_config()` accepts `sl_config_t` for input/output fds, prompt
  wrapping width, live scroll regions, queueing, themes, status lines, history length,
  and line length.
- `sl_config_init()` sets the documented defaults:
  - input fd: `STDIN_FILENO`
  - output fd: `STDOUT_FILENO`
  - ordinary readline at the current cursor
  - history max length: 100
  - line max length: 4096 bytes
  - prompt queueing and live scroll regions: disabled
  - prompt queue capacity and previews when enabled: 64 and 3
  - prompt theme: ANSI-only `default`
  - status line and spinner: disabled
  - status busy state and idle marker: false and `+`
- `readline()` returns a project-allocated string that must be released with
  `free_string()`.
- `last_readline_status()` classifies the most recent `readline()` outcome as
  submitted text, EOF, cancellation, interrupt, or error.
- Free-function wrappers mirror the receiver methods. Receiver methods are the
  primary handle-oriented style; wrappers provide conventional C call sites and
  NULL-argument guarding.

Each handle owns its own:

- editable line buffer
- cursor position
- history list
- terminal raw-mode state
- rendered prompt cache
- prompt queue, theme, and status-line state
- key bindings
- idle callback
- last-error text

softline does not keep global editor state.

## Current Editing Behavior

The editor supports these built-in behaviors:

- `Enter` submits the current buffer.
- `Ctrl-J` inserts a newline.
- `Ctrl-L` rereads PTY geometry, restores owned scroll margins and repaints
  the prompt, status and queue rows, including unchanged cached cells. It
  preserves the draft/cursor, history search, approval focus, queue identities,
  producer position and pending ANSI/UTF-8 fragments. It leaves the transcript
  intact and does not replay output. Bindings can override `SL_KEY_CTRL_L` or
  return `SL_KEY_ACTION_RESET` from another key in C and Lua.
- `Ctrl-D` returns `NULL` on an empty buffer and deletes forward inside text.
- `Ctrl-C` restores terminal state and raises `SIGINT`.
- `Ctrl-A` / Home moves to the start of the current newline-delimited line.
- `Ctrl-E` / End moves to the end of the current newline-delimited line.
  Soft wrapping does not create line boundaries for either command.
- `Ctrl-B` / Left and `Ctrl-F` / Right move by common UTF-8 cluster boundaries.
- Up and Down navigate visual rows first, then history where applicable.
  Consecutive vertical movements retain their preferred screen column across
  short or empty rows. Other navigation, editing and width changes reset it;
  producer output and Ctrl-L preserve it.
  `Ctrl-P` and `Ctrl-N` navigate previous and next history entries directly.
- `Ctrl-R` starts reverse incremental search over the handle's current history.
  `history_search_active()` reports this mode, including a failed match, and
  returns false after selection, cancellation or editor exit. It is a read-only
  query on the editor-owner thread, exposed in both C and Lua. Key callbacks
  run before built-in handling; submission guards should pass search keys
  through so Enter selects an editable match. The chat examples do this for
  shell and exit guards, retaining their restrictions on actual submissions.
  Typing updates the query, repeated `Ctrl-R` cycles older matches and wraps,
  Enter accepts the displayed match into the normal editable prompt without
  submitting or queueing it; a subsequent Enter follows the normal keymap.
  Escape or `Ctrl-G` restores the draft. An explicit Enter binding requesting
  `SL_KEY_ACTION_SUBMIT` can opt into immediate submission during search.
- `Ctrl-V` in the TTY editor saves PNG or JPEG data from the X11 `CLIPBOARD`
  selection to an owner-only cache file and inserts its visible absolute path
  at the cursor. The image file persists after the handle closes. On Linux,
  X11 is accessed directly over Unix or TCP sockets with Xauthority credentials,
  including a `DISPLAY` forwarded by `ssh -Y`. No host X11 library is required.
  Both Linux library forms embed MIT-licensed c-ares 1.34.8 privately. TCP
  display hosts support literal IPv4/IPv6, `/etc/hosts`, then DNS configured by
  `/etc/resolv.conf`, including search domains. Lookup shares the clipboard's
  10-second deadline and uses no libc NSS modules or additional link libraries.
  The default path is `${XDG_CACHE_HOME}/softline/{xid}.png` or `.jpeg`,
  falling back to `$HOME/.cache/softline/` when `XDG_CACHE_HOME` is unset or
  relative. The xid is 20 lowercase base32hex characters in the
  [rs/xid](https://github.com/rs/xid) format, generated internally.
  `image_paste_path_template` in the config or the receiver setter
  `set_image_paste_path_template()` overrides the path. An override must be an
  absolute path template with exactly one `*` for the xid; `~/` and
  `{{HOME}}`, `{{home}}`, `{{XDG_CACHE_HOME}}`, `{{xdg_cache_home}}` expand to
  their directories. The XDG token follows the same fallback rule. The image
  type always appends `.png` or `.jpeg` after substitution, including when the
  template already ends in an extension. For example, `/tmp/softline/*/image`
  creates `/tmp/softline/{xid}/image.png`. Parents are created recursively.
  `disable_image_paste = 1` disables built-in capture; the draft stays intact
  and `last_error()` reports that it is disabled. If the clipboard lacks a supported image,
  the draft stays unchanged and `last_error()` explains the failure. A custom
  binding for `SL_KEY_CTRL_V` overrides the built-in paste. This operation is
  unavailable on other platforms and does not change bracketed text paste.
- `Alt-B` moves to the current or preceding alphanumeric word's beginning;
  `Alt-F` moves to the current or next word's end. Punctuation separates words.
  Unicode 16 letters, marks and numbers participate without splitting clusters.
- `Alt-D` kills through the next alphanumeric word's end; `Alt-Backspace`
  kills back to the preceding word's beginning. These word motions may cross
  actual newlines; Ctrl-W retains the line boundary described below.
- `Ctrl-T` transposes adjacent Unicode clusters. At a newline or buffer end it
  swaps the preceding pair; at buffer start or with no preceding pair it is a no-op.
- Backspace and Delete operate at the cursor.
- `Ctrl-K` deletes from the cursor to the next newline or buffer end, preserving
  later lines. At a newline it removes only that newline, joining the lines;
  at buffer end it does nothing. Soft wrapping does not create line boundaries.
- `Ctrl-U` deletes from the current newline-delimited line's start to the cursor,
  preserving the preceding newline. At line start it removes only that preceding
  newline, joining the lines. At buffer start it does nothing; soft wrapping does
  not create line boundaries.
- `Ctrl-W` deletes the preceding whitespace-delimited word and any trailing spaces
  or tabs within the current actual line. At line start it removes only the
  preceding newline, preserving words on the previous line. At buffer start it
  does nothing.
- Ctrl-U/K/W and Alt-D/Alt-Backspace save text in a ten-entry kill ring owned by
  the handle. Consecutive kills append or prepend in textual order. Ctrl-Y inserts
  the newest kill, and repeated Alt-Y rotates the immediately preceding yank.
  Other editing/navigation ends yank rotation. Focused approval decisions retain
  priority over Alt-Y. A yank exceeding `line_max_len` leaves the draft unchanged.
- `Ctrl-_` and `Ctrl-X Ctrl-U` undo the last editing command. Continuous typing
  and each bracketed paste are single undo groups; callback buffer edits within
  one key command form a group. Undo restores text and cursor, preserving queue
  identities and approval holds. Loading another queued/history entry or starting
  a new readline resets undo; cancelling reverse search preserves it. The kill
  ring persists across these boundaries. Undo contains draft edits only.
- Bracketed paste mode is enabled while editing; pasted carriage returns become
  buffer content instead of submitting the prompt.
- Input is limited by `line_max_len`.
- Editing falls back to a plain line reader when either input or output is not
  a TTY; it does not emit prompts.

The command names follow the [GNU Readline reference](https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rluserman.html).
For actual newline boundaries, the supported line-deletion commands follow
[prompt_toolkit's multiline Readline bindings](https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/main/src/prompt_toolkit/key_binding/bindings/named_commands.py).
Ctrl-W additionally stops its word scan at the current line's beginning.

UTF-8 is preserved as bytes while rendering uses terminal-cell width for
combining marks, East Asian wide characters, and common emoji sequences.
Cursor and delete operations avoid splitting common UTF-8 clusters. Public
cursor offsets remain byte offsets.

## Current Rendering Behavior

softline renders multiline prompts directly to a terminal fd.

Current rendering guarantees:

- Long input wraps.
- Word runs are kept together where terminal width allows.
- Exact-width rows avoid accidental terminal autowrap prompt duplication.
- Prompts can grow at the bottom of a terminal without overwriting prior output.
- Resize is handled while `readline()` is idle.
- Render capacity is derived from the configured line length rather than a fixed
  row cap.
- Render failures during active editing return as errors, not as submitted
  input.

Ordinary readline participates in terminal scrollback. Persistent chat uses
native full-width output beginning at the original cursor and a prompt
at the terminal bottom. After physical resize, an active editor returns to the
current bottom and restores its output margin even while no output arrives.
A retained frame between editor calls follows native reflow until editing resumes.
Rectangular viewports and bounds configuration are unsupported.
Softline never implies a retained full transcript.

Ordinary readline width changes reconcile the old prompt's physical rows and
cursor before updating its layout. Cursor reports locate the frame when the
terminal supports them; only owned prompt rows are rewritten. The replacement
frame uses normal terminal scrolling when it needs additional space.


### Prompt Queue

Interactive ordinary readline and native chat prompts can opt into a prompt queue through
configuration or `set_prompt_queue()`. Non-TTY input remains a plain line
reader, so queueing does not alter it. Tab moves a nonempty active editor into
the queue and clears the editor; Tab on an empty editor does nothing. Alt-E
removes the most recent queue entry and restores it to the active editor for
editing.

`next_prompt()` is the dispatch boundary. With automatic delivery it removes
the oldest ordinary queued entry before opening the editor and reports
`SL_PROMPT_SOURCE_QUEUED`. With manual delivery the host selects entries by
mode and takes them at safe seams or turn boundaries. An editor submission
reports `SL_PROMPT_SOURCE_DIRECT`; promotion of a queued entry reports
`SL_PROMPT_SOURCE_PROMOTED`. Existing `readline()` callers remain direct-only.

While an editor is active, the renderer owns a queue panel above it. The panel
shows a total count plus a capped oldest-first preview list, and supports all
built-in prompt themes, including the ANSI-only `default` theme. The selected
prompt theme also styles the active editor and optional status line in both
ordinary readline and native chat sessions. The panel is not built with `print_above()` because
queue entries must be removable and must reflow with the active editor.
Application key bindings retain precedence over the Tab and Alt-E defaults.

Each entry has a nonzero opaque ID, allocated monotonically per handle and
never reused, and an approval hold independent of QUEUED/STEER intent. C
`sl_prompt_queue_append()` and `sl_prompt_queue_insert()` take a hold flag and
optional ID output. Lua `queue_append`/`queue_insert` take an optional boolean
hold and return the ID. `sl_prompt_queue_info()` / Lua `queue_info()` expose
`id`, `mode`, `held`, `policy`, `stopped`, and `eligible`. Held entries appear in the approval panel/count;
ordinary Q/S previews remain visible and use their own preview limit.

Automatic delivery skips held entries while preserving FIFO order among
eligible ordinary entries. Held entries cannot be taken or promoted. The host
calls `sl_prompt_queue_approve()` or `sl_prompt_queue_reject()` by ID (Lua:
`queue_approve` / `queue_reject`); approval releases only the hold and respects
busy, manual delivery and steering. Approval decisions are FIFO by arrival,
including entries created with insert/append and an entry being edited.
Out-of-order approve/reject calls fail with `SL_ERROR_INVALID` without mutation.
Rejection removes only the selected entry. Conversation-wide auto-approval
releases all waiting holds as described below.

Alt-E retains the entry's identity, mode and hold while editing and reserves
its queue slot. `sl_prompt_queue_draft_info()` / `queue_draft_info()` expose
that origin. Requeueing or submitting a held edit retains the same ID, hold and
arrival position for delivery, including when auto-approval releases waiting holds;
editing is never implicit approval. Empty submission, cancellation, EOF or read
failure restores the original entry, discarding edits. The host may approve or
reject an active edit by ID; rejection clears its draft. Clearing the queue preserves an active
edit; disabling it during an edit fails. A held edit is visibly marked.

Hosts inject messages through `sl_inject_queued_prompt()` or
`sl_inject_steer_prompt()` (Lua: `inject_queued_prompt`, `inject_steer_prompt`).
Both return stable identities and use the same conversation-wide approval
policy. Queueing must be enabled; calls run on the editor owner thread,
including from descriptor-watch callbacks. Queued injections use ordinary
FIFO delivery. Steering injections retain STEER intent for the host to take
at a safe response seam. Approval never changes the selected destination.

`sl_set_auto_approval()` / Lua `set_auto_approval()` sets automatic approval
for the entire conversation's Softline instance. It is off initially.
Enabling it immediately approves **all** waiting entries, including an active
edit and explicit holds created through queue insert/append, and future
injections bypass approval. It preserves text, identity, ordering, busy state,
delivery mode and steering intent, and does not submit an active draft.
Disabling it does not revoke approvals. `sl_get_auto_approval()` / Lua
`get_auto_approval()` reads the setting, which survives queue clear/disable.

Softline renders and handles inline approval controls. The oldest held entry
is offered only when the input buffer is empty and pending terminal input has
been consumed; paste, history search and an active queued edit defer it.
A nonempty draft defers a new question and shows a passive pending count.
Once offered, a question stays visible when typing resumes; the input keeps
its contents, cursor and keyboard focus. Sending or clearing a draft permits
a new question at the next empty input boundary. Editing, requeueing, cancellation
and reopening input cannot move another approval ahead of the first. Submitting
an empty queued edit restores the original entry and releases the editor for
approval review; it never approves or delivers that entry. Later
held messages remain hidden except in the waiting count until it is decided.
The question shows the message and its queued/steering route:
Alt-A explicitly focuses the approval, inverting the foreground/background of
its compact heading and moving the cursor onto its approval controls.
Alt-Y approves and Alt-N rejects
(case-insensitive), only while focused. Enter never answers an approval;
arrow keys retain ordinary editor/history behavior. Escape or Alt-A returns
focus to the ordinary input without answering. Alt-E edits the full offered
entry with either focus state,
even if newer entries exist. Approval headings use `A ` in the two-column
gutter; normal text and wrapped continuations start with two spaces.
Editing/submitting/requeueing retains
its hold until explicit approval or auto-approval. Ctrl-L preserves approval
focus while recovering layout. Other editing keys return to normal
editing; plain Y/N are ordinary text even when focused. Focused Alt-Y/Alt-N,
focus dismissal and offered-entry Alt-E take precedence over application
bindings; other bindings keep their usual behavior.
Non-TTY handles use the same holds and APIs without interactive
approval controls. Ordinary typed prompts never acquire approval holds.

The approval area uses an `A ` heading combining the count, controls and
Queued/Steering route, followed by at most three indented message rows.
The singular count reads `1 approval`; plural counts read `N awaiting approval`.
Headings and message text wrap at word boundaries to the terminal width;
tokens wider than a row wrap at grapheme boundaries. Message previews count
wrapped rows toward the three-row limit and append `...` to the final row when
text is omitted, keeping whole words where they fit beside the ellipsis.
Only presentation is truncated: editing and delivery retain
the full original text. Page Up/Down keep their ordinary binding behavior.

`sl_last_prompt_id()` / Lua `last_prompt_id()` reports the ID delivered by the
last read/take, including directly submitted queued edits. Ordinary direct
input and unsuccessful reads/takes report zero. Lua `next_prompt()` returns
`line, source, id`, and `queue_take()` returns `text, id`. This receiver/API
extension first shipped with ABI 2. Native admission/execution policies extend
the receiver and entry layout to ABI 3, one increment from released v0.13.0.

`sl_set_prompt_queue_policy()` (Lua `set_queue_policy`) installs an optional,
short owner-thread classifier for deliberate interactive submission. It only
inspects state and returns boolean `enqueue`, `independent` and `executable`
fields. Passive enqueue never calls it. Opted-in submissions enter the visible
native queue even while idle; callback failures and full queues preserve the
draft. Pending keys, paste and history selection precede automatic delivery, so
same-burst Alt-E can edit the admitted entry before it runs. Editing preserves
its identity, reserved position, approval and stop state; history appends only
once at admission. Non-TTY input remains unchanged.

`sl_prompt_queue_set_executable()` (Lua `queue_set_executable`) updates execution
readiness by identity, including an active edit. This is independent of approval
and cancellation. Managed entries use explicit execution readiness rather than
the busy signal, including steering; manual mode still prevents automatic
delivery. Updates from watch callbacks schedule delivery through the native
reactor. Effective `eligible` metadata and `prompt_queue_take()` share the native
ordering and hold checks. Ordinary turns retain FIFO ordering. Steering keeps
its seam priority over ordinary turns, but cannot pass an earlier managed
command or waive its own execution hold. Legacy approval suggestions do not
hold ordinary user input;
independent feed-local queries may pass blocked work without modifying it or
changing FIFO approval decisions. No command names are built into Softline.

Cancellation marks retained entries as stopped. Fresh managed submissions can
execute without releasing that backlog, while passive enqueues and edits retain
the stop. Explicit Alt-Enter promotion resumes only that entry, with draft and
empty-editor promotion both retaining execution holds. `sl_get_prompt_queue_stopped()`
(Lua `queue_stopped`) inspects the backlog stop; `sl_prompt_queue_resume()`
(Lua `queue_resume`) explicitly resumes it while preserving manual mode, active
edits, approval and execution holds. An automatic delivery setter never clears
the stop. Ordinary profiles retain their existing direct-submission behavior.

### Prompt Themes And Status Lines

The renderer owns prompt presentation so the marker, typed text, queue panel,
and optional status line always share the active layout. The built-in `default`
theme uses only standard 16-colour ANSI sequences: a bold bright-white marker,
normal terminal-colour input, subdued dark-gray queue text and separators,
standard-colour status elements, and red/green busy markers. `plain` is
uncoloured for the editor and queue, while quoted prompts and status messages
use neutral ANSI styling. The remaining named themes use their embedded
palettes.

Status lines are opt-in rows between queue previews and the editor. A theme has
eight element colours. `statusline_start_element` selects the first palette
slot and later elements advance modulo eight. Softline retains at most 32
elements; a longer bulk update uses the first 31 followed by `...`. Element
text must be valid UTF-8 without C0/C1 controls or DEL. Idle shows
a green `+` by default; callers can supply another printable ASCII marker or
`'\0'` for a blank reserved slot. Busy shows a red `x`, or a red 500ms
`/-\\|` spinner when both busy and spinner are enabled.

An optional status message sits immediately above the status line. The default
`! ` prefix uses the theme's muted colour and the italic message uses its
secondary colour. The host may update or clear it during an active output
session. Long text wraps at words and continuation rows are indented to the
display width of the configurable prefix. The C and Lua APIs expose separate
theme colour choices for the prefix and message text.

## Current Extension Points

Persistent output is renderer-agnostic. The C and Lua APIs expose begin,
write, and end, and the C chat example composes libmdf externally. See
[the composition contract](softline-mdf-stream-design.md). Softline does not
link libmdf or own its document lifecycle.

The C and Lua chat examples support exact `!sh` and `/shell` submissions
without arguments on interactive terminals, only between operations. Enter or
idle Alt-Enter launches `$SHELL -i`, falling back to `/bin/sh -i` when unset or
empty. Busy submissions and attempts to queue or steer these commands are
rejected while leaving the draft editable. Argument-bearing text remains an
ordinary chat turn. The application closes its idle output session, runs the
shell with ordinary terminal input and full scrolling, then begins a fresh
session at its final cursor and current geometry. Clear and resize inside the
shell are allowed. History, queue and configuration survive on the same handle;
transcript replay is unnecessary. Failed launches and nonzero exits report an
error and return to chat. This uses existing output-session APIs and adds no
library shell-execution API or ABI change.

Alt-S uses the same between-operation shell handoff without submitting the
draft. A key callback returns `SL_KEY_ACTION_SUSPEND`; the editor returns NULL
(nil in Lua) with `SL_READLINE_SUSPENDED`, retaining text, cursor, preferred
column, undo, kill ring, reverse search, history navigation and approval/edit
state. The next readline/next_prompt resumes that continuation before automatic
queue delivery. Held edits retain their identity, position and explicit approval
requirement. Suspending does not append history, approve, requeue or cancel.
The application runs the child outside callbacks, after ending its output
session, then begins a fresh session and resumes editing. Shell clear/resize
changes the physical layout only: owned UI wraps at the current geometry, with
no producer transcript storage or replay. Exact `!sh` and `/shell` submissions
still return to an empty prompt. Suspension does not pause background producers;
the caller must arrange exclusive terminal ownership. The examples reject Alt-S
while an operation is running. The generic action and status extend existing
enums without changing the public receiver/configuration layouts or ABI.

Host buffer replacements and insertions during suspension are journaled like
active edits, including while the output session is closed. No-op or rejected
mutations do not add undo entries. Undo validates a complete command group
against the current draft length and allocation before changing bytes. Context
changes such as accepting history search or rejecting an edited approval retire
the old journal. Producer redraws preserve the preferred editing column unless
the effective wrapping width changes. Unsupported Ctrl-X chords consume their
complete UTF-8 character without leaking continuation bytes into the draft.

Public cursor navigation ends typing coalescing in idle/watch callbacks as well
as key bindings. A suspend callback that changes the draft or cursor ends its
command normally: its edits form one undo group, separate from typing after
resumption. Only a suspension without editor changes preserves the preceding
command identity, including yank rotation.

Vertical navigation clamps the preferred column to a cursor position owned by
the requested visual row. A soft-wrap endpoint belongs to the following row;
hard-newline positions remain on their preceding row. Rows containing only
expanded tab continuation cells are skipped because no draft cursor position
exists there. Navigation can reach the EOF position after an exactly full final
row; its continuation row is painted only while the cursor occupies it.

The C and Lua APIs also expose a quoted-prompt writer for an open output
session. It wraps literal submitted text, repeats a configurable prefix on
each visible row, and adds only the line breaks needed for one empty row on
either side. The quote prefix and italic text have independent colours.

### Key Bindings

`bind_key()` attaches a per-handle callback to a key. The callback may:

- handle the key completely
- pass through to built-in behavior
- submit
- cancel
- interrupt
- reset prompt layout from PTY geometry while preserving editor/producer state
- mutate the active buffer with public methods such as `insert()`,
  `set_buffer()`, `set_cursor()`, `submit()`, and `cancel()`

Current key coverage includes common control keys, arrows, Home/End, Delete,
Paste Begin/End, F1-F10, distinguishable Ctrl-Enter sequences, and Alt-letter
keys represented through `SL_KEY_ALT_BASE`.

### Idle Callback

`set_idle_callback()` registers a callback invoked while `readline()` is active
and no input byte is available. It can update the buffer, print above the
prompt, submit, or cancel through public methods.

This remains a local owner-thread hook. Use external watches for immediate
application wakeups while an editor is active.

### External Watches

`watch_add()` registers an application-owned descriptor on an interactive
handle. During `readline()` and `next_prompt()`, Softline waits for terminal
input and registered watch readiness together, then invokes the callback on the
same owner thread. The callback drains bounded application work and may print
above the prompt, mutate queue state, and update status without racing the
active editor. Softline does not read, close, duplicate, or change flags on a
watched descriptor. Non-TTY handles reject watches. To preserve interactive
fairness, ready watches are visited round-robin and Softline dispatches at most
eight callbacks before it gives terminal input another chance to run.

### Streaming Output Above Prompt

Native chat sizes the prompt from its current rendered frame. Empty queue
slots and absent status messages reserve no rows. Adding or removing queue,
status, or editor rows adjusts the output margin immediately. Growth scrolls
existing output cells only by the rows needed to fit; shrink clears former
prompt cells and returns their rows to output without moving transcript cells.
The editor pages only when the frame exceeds the physical terminal capacity;
queue and status rows stay visible whenever they fit.

`print_above()` accepts a chunk callback and writes all chunks above the active
prompt. The callback returns `SL_OK` with a non-empty chunk to continue, or
`SL_OK` with length `0` to finish.

`output_stream_begin()` opens a persistent session; every later
`output_stream_write()` forwards its byte span immediately, without waiting for
EOF or the next prompt. Full-terminal transcripts start at the existing cursor;
the editable prompt starts at the bottom. Producer
bytes pass through unchanged in a VT scroll region above the prompt. Native
transcript text is never cached, padded, rewrapped, cleared, or replayed.
Prompt updates compare the previous frame and patch only changed cells; output
feeds preserve unchanged prompt cells and restore the editor cursor. The
scroll region ends immediately above the current prompt frame.
Resize anchors the active editor at the current terminal bottom, updating only
changed prompt cells or placement and internal output geometry. The output
margin is restored during reconciliation, before output resumes. The terminal
owns transcript reflow; retained inactive frames follow that native position.
Ending chat restores the full scroll region and clears input rows while
retaining queue and status rows. The cursor stays at column zero on the current
input row; exit adds no newline or scroll. `clear_prompt_on_exit` defaults to zero;
setting it to one clears the whole prompt area and returns below the transcript.
Ending a producer session inside an active editor retains the native prompt and
scroll region for subsequent finite output or another stream; closing the handle
always restores terminal state. Non-TTY sessions emit no teardown controls.
Closing an idle native output session also releases terminal input ownership.
Applications may run a foreground child before beginning another session to
probe its final cursor and build a fresh prompt, retaining history and settings.
This handoff belongs between editor calls, outside active editor callbacks;
the application owns child execution. Ending the stream does not finish an
external renderer document. Incomplete ANSI/UTF-8 returns `SL_ERROR_INVALID`
(Lua: `nil, softline.ERROR_INVALID`) and leaves the session open for the missing
bytes.
Reopening a closed native session probes the cursor again. A nonzero column
restarts quote separation for an unfinished externally written line; otherwise
known spacing remains. An editor-retained session keeps its continuation state.
Native feeds batch bounded chunks with cursor restoration and retry short
writes as needed, without cursor visibility toggles or repainting unchanged
frames. Feed calls add no intentional delay and never request or wait for a
terminal cursor reply, including on resize. Local scalar widths shared with
prompt layout track advances. Terminal Unicode versions and cluster shaping
can differ from the Unicode 16.0 accounting;
producer bytes and wrapping remain unchanged. No producer text or grapheme
lookahead is retained.
An owner-thread watch callback can feed an external renderer and forward each
sink emission directly while editing and queueing continue. Softline stores
cursor geometry and bounded partial ANSI/UTF-8 state. Plain ASCII lines use a
scalar cell count; Unicode uses conventional scalar widths without glyph span
tables. Cursor reports outside feed calls can record ownership boundaries.
Width resize retains the tracked endpoint for an opaque
line, clamping an offscreen column. Exact continuation after Unicode/tab reflow,
including CR-overwritten tails, is deliberately outside the contract. It retains
no producer text for resize. Carriage return preserves the visible tail of an
ASCII line; its cursor position and extent are tracked separately.
SGR and UTF-8 sequences can cross writes; ending with an incomplete sequence
fails and keeps the session open.
With an active prompt, a printable continuation after a known ASCII write ending
at the terminal's right edge uses CR and IND after the cursor handoff. The
resulting hard row boundary can remain split after width growth, and a Unicode
cluster divided there may lose its attachment. The accepted scope and rationale
are recorded in `softline-mdf-stream-design.md` under the active-prompt
right-edge review exception.
At the bottom output margin, width growth can reflow a row boundary differently
in VTE and tmux; exact continuation at that seam is outside the native contract
without transcript replay. Rapid tmux resize commands can also update its
visible grid before the matching PTY size reaches Softline, so output emitted
in that interval may be corrupted. The paced resize tests do not cover this
queued-notification diagnostic.

For finite `print_above()` output on an ordinary readline prompt, rendering uses
normal clear-and-redraw scrollback by default. Set `live_scroll_region = 1` in
`sl_config_t` or call `sl_set_live_scroll_region()` to opt into a
cursor-position probe at startup and between producer callbacks as output
advances the prompt to the terminal bottom. Multiple feeds in one callback
stay immediate; ownership is refreshed at the next input-owned boundary. When
supported, softline temporarily scrolls the full-width region above the
retained prompt, avoiding a prompt
repaint while keeping queue, status, wrapping, and resize reflow aligned to the
bottom. The terminal scroll region is reset on every completion, cancellation,
error, and handle teardown. If the terminal does not answer the probe, output
uses the compatible clear-and-redraw path.

After a TTY live session, finite `print_above()` output continues in native
terminal scrollback. Producer output accepts printable UTF-8 and ANSI SGR
bytes without cell reserialization.

## Current History Behavior

History is per handle.

Supported behavior:

- add entries manually or opt into recording accepted editor/queue drafts
- cap history length
- navigate history during editing
- preserve an edited draft while moving through history
- reverse incremental search over manually added or explicitly loaded entries
- save and load history snapshots, bypassing append on imports
- attach synchronous custom load/append hooks in C and Lua
- load/append native keyed XDG state files with shared-process locking
- recover incomplete final records and explicitly compact under the same lock
- encode multiline history entries
- reject oversized history records without splitting them
- force saved history files to owner-only permissions

softline does not currently provide a global history registry, timestamped
history, configurable duplicate suppression, forward search, history expansion, or
shell-style history metadata.

## Current Error And Cleanup Behavior

- Most fallible methods return `SL_OK` or a negative `sl_status_t`.
- `readline()` returns `NULL` for EOF, cancel, interrupt, or failure.
- `last_readline_status()` distinguishes those `NULL` outcomes and also records
  successful submitted text.
- `last_error()` exposes the most recent diagnostic string.
- `destroy(NULL)` is safe.
- Public string results are released through `free_string()`.
- Terminal raw mode and bracketed paste are restored on normal return, cancel,
  interrupt, and tested error paths.
- While Softline owns raw mode, kernel tab expansion (`TAB3`/`OXTABS`, such as
  `stty -tabs`) is disabled so the terminal handles producer tabs. OPOST/ONLCR
  and other output flags are preserved. Original flags are restored on release,
  including when input and output are separate TTYs. Softline does not expand
  tabs into producer bytes.
  Native writes after raw-mode release borrow the same output flags for each
  write and restore them before returning, without flushing pending input.

The return value remains optimized for the common case: a non-`NULL` result is
submitted text, while `NULL` means no submitted text. Callers that need precise
classification should read `last_readline_status()` before the next
`readline()` call.

## Current Packaging And Portability

softline currently targets C89 plus POSIX terminal APIs.

Current build surfaces include:

- CMake presets
- static and shared library builds
- shared-library ABI/SOVERSION policy through the source-owned
  `SOFTLINE_ABI_VERSION`, currently `3`, decoupled from the project release
  version and not a CMake cache option. Queue policy methods and entry-state
  fields change exposed C layouts, advancing exactly once from released
  v0.13.0's ABI 2. Consumers must rebuild.
- installed CMake package exports with canonical target `softline::softline`
- installed pkg-config metadata
- Lua 5.5 facade packaged as LuaRocks source artifacts
- example binaries
- Lua examples matching the simple and chat workflows
- CTest unit/example coverage
- Lua facade smoke coverage
- sanitizer test target
- package verification scripts
- external installed-package consumer smoke test

The library is not currently a Windows console implementation, a terminfo
database consumer, or a curses-style screen abstraction.

## Gap List Toward A More Complete Multiline Readline Alternative

This section is a product and engineering backlog, not a promise that every item
belongs in softline. Each item should get tests before being considered part of
the public contract.

### Completion

Missing:

- completion callback API
- completion menus
- common-prefix insertion
- completion replacement spans
- multiline-aware completion display
- async completion lifecycle
- completion cancellation
- completion tests across wrapped prompts and native chat

Likely API shape:

- register a completion provider per handle
- pass immutable buffer, cursor, and prompt context to the provider
- return owned completion candidates plus optional replacement range
- keep rendering policy in softline rather than forcing callbacks to draw

### Hints And Autosuggestions

Missing:

- right-side hints
- inline ghost text
- validation messages
- async suggestion updates
- style policy for hints in narrow terminals

Important constraint: hints must never become submitted buffer content unless the
user accepts them explicitly.

### Searchable History

Supported:

- reverse incremental search
- search prompt rendering inside multiline and native chat sessions
- accept/cancel search state

Missing:

- forward search
- history filtering hooks
- duplicate suppression options

### Editing Model

Missing or incomplete compared with mature readline-style editors:

- kill ring
- yank / yank-pop
- undo / redo
- transpose character / word
- case operations
- region/mark operations
- configurable word-boundary policy
- full Emacs-style command set
- vi insert/normal mode
- keymap layers

softline currently has a small fixed editing model plus per-key callbacks.

### Unicode And Width Semantics

Current behavior is UTF-8-preserving and terminal-width-aware for common
interactive prompt input. It is not a complete Unicode Text Segmentation or
locale policy implementation.

Missing:

- full Unicode grapheme-cluster segmentation
- locale-specific ambiguous-width policy
- Unicode normalization policy
- invalid UTF-8 policy
- locale-aware width tests
- callback APIs that expose both byte offsets and character-cell positions

This is one of the larger gaps for a production-grade multiline readline
alternative.

### Terminal Capability Handling

Current behavior emits common ANSI/VT-style escape sequences.

Missing:

- terminfo/termcap capability lookup
- terminal feature detection
- fallback strategies for limited terminals
- configurable bracketed paste support
- richer key sequence decoding
- mouse/pointer policy, if ever needed
- robust behavior under terminal multiplexers with unusual sequences

### Event Loop And Async Integration

Interactive reads are an owner-thread reactor over terminal input and watched
application descriptors. Workers signal an application-created wake FD; they
must never call Softline directly. Future work may add a separately driven
session API or platform-specific backends, but it must preserve this
single-owner rendering rule.

### Output And Transcript Management

`print_above()` and a persistent output session handle chunked output above the
active prompt. Softline retains cursor geometry and bounded parser state, with
scalar cell counts shared with prompt layout. Producer output has no glyph-span
or cluster reconstruction model. A bounded counter of viewport shifts helps
compute cursor deltas when growth restores only part of the terminal history;
no transcript rows, cells or strings are kept by Softline.
The terminal owns transcript cells and scrollback. Physical resizing leaves
surviving output cells as the terminal reflowed them; changing the output
margin does not scroll them again. Output clipped off the top is not recovered
or replayed by Softline. If an unfinished line moves into scrollback, its next
fragment starts at the first visible output row instead of adding empty rows
down to the prompt. If the clipped position was at a hard line boundary, new
output starts next to the prompt. Native scrollback cells and spacing remain
unchanged.
Positions are tracked relative to the terminal bottom,
without terminal cursor save/restore. Resize reconciliation queries the live
input cursor to account for terminal movement and adjusts only owned prompt
rows whose cells or placement changed. Fitted, unchanged rows are preserved.
Width changes rebuild prompt layout. The active editable prompt stays at the
terminal bottom even when unchanged text fits the larger terminal.

A physical resize can race an in-flight VT batch and misplace even ASCII
output. This accepted concurrency limit is documented with its reproducer in
the stream design's concurrent physical resize exception. Regression gates
test stable resize boundaries; the unpaused diagnostic remains available.
An unobserved resize of a retained frame also has a deliberate immediate-feed
fallback limit: earlier hard-ended ASCII reflow and unknown terminal history
cannot be inferred from the current-line delta. This includes writes after
readline returns. The stream design documents its reproducer and policy source;
the active input loop observes resize before dispatching producer watches.

Missing:

- scrollback buffer abstraction for alternate-screen applications
- offscreen transcript replay or scrollback
- caller-driven reflow of already emitted content after resize
- arbitrary terminal controls beyond documented SGR

These transcript-management features are outside the current native chat
contract. There is one full-width chat layout, and no boxed viewport API.

### Styling

Missing:

- prompt styling API
- syntax highlighting callback
- completion/hint style policy
- active selection style
- terminal color capability handling
- style reset guarantees around callbacks

Any styling API must preserve byte ownership and terminal reset safety.

### Persistence And History Policy

History persistence is opt-in. `history_set_backend()` copies a nonempty key,
loads oldest-first through a scoped emitter, and attaches the append hook only
on success. Loading is staged: an invalid import or failed hook preserves the
prior backend and retained entries. Imports, including `history_load()`, bypass
append. Append hooks run synchronously before a newly accepted history entry is
committed to recall; failure leaves recall unchanged. Custom backend rollback
and userdata lifetime belong to the application. History callbacks cannot
reenter history operations or destroy the handle. C receiver/free APIs and Lua
methods expose the same behavior; Lua emitters reject use outside their load.

`history_open(key, directory)` attaches the native backend. Exact key bytes map
to a SHA-256 filename under `$XDG_STATE_HOME/softline/history`, falling back to
`$HOME/.local/state` for absent, empty or relative XDG values. An absolute override
selects the complete directory. Missing directories are recursively created
0700; the store directory is private. Files and stable per-key lock files are
0600, regular, user-owned and not symlinks/hard links. No additional link library
or terminal I/O is involved.

The format has one physical LF-terminated record per prompt. Backslash, LF,
CR and Tab escape as `\\`, `\n`, `\r`, `\t`; other UTF-8 bytes are literal.
Native load ignores an incomplete final record, and native append truncates it
under the key lock before writing the next complete record. Records exceeding
line_max_len or containing NUL are rejected. Legacy snapshot loading still
accepts an unterminated final record and CRLF line endings. Snapshot saving is
an explicit overwrite and does not participate in native shared-file locking.

Each append completes immediately; no save is deferred to exit and no per-entry
fsync is promised. Same-key processes serialize load, append and explicit
compaction through a separate stable flock lock file, including independent handles in
one process. Compaction rereads the shared
file with bounded retained entries and atomically renames a private replacement,
so a stale handle cannot discard unseen committed prompts. No automatic
compaction or metadata/version marker is added. Recall is per handle, bounded
by its cap and updated by explicit loading; a zero cap disables recording.
Empty and consecutive duplicate entries are suppressed.

`history_set_auto_add()` is disabled by default. When enabled, accepted direct
editor submissions and queue/steer drafts enter history immediately. Queue
release/promotion, cancelled/rejected drafts and Ctrl-R selection do not append.
Programmatic queue insertion/replacement stays application-controlled. Both chat
examples enable auto-add and attach the shared `softline.examples.chat` key at
startup; their `SOFTLINE_HISTORY_DIR` override keeps tests repository-local.
`history_close()` retains recall and recording policy, detaching without saves.

Timestamped metadata, configurable duplicate policy and power-loss durability
are outside this simple prompt store.

### Diagnostics

Missing:

- structured error object
- callback failure propagation detail
- optional diagnostic callback

This is important if softline becomes a lower-level component for larger
interactive applications.

### Portability

Missing:

- Windows console backend
- non-POSIX fallback strategy
- broader OS matrix tests
- terminal emulator compatibility matrix
- package smoke tests on more targets

### Security And Robustness

Areas that need continued hardening:

- malformed escape sequence handling
- very large configured line limits
- hostile terminal dimensions
- repeated resize storms
- callback reentrancy policy
- signal interaction beyond Ctrl-C
- explicit history snapshot overwrite semantics outside native store locking

### Compatibility With Readline Expectations

softline does not currently aim for Readline ABI or API compatibility.

Missing if that goal changes:

- Readline-compatible headers or adapter layer
- Readline-style global variables
- `.inputrc` parsing
- named commands
- macro recording/playback
- completion API compatibility
- history API compatibility
- redisplay hooks

The current architecture is handle-oriented and intentionally not Readline's
global-state model. A compatibility layer should be considered a separate
facade, not a reason to weaken the core handle model.

## Suggested Near-Term Milestones

1. Completion provider API

   Add synchronous completion with replacement spans and native chat tests.

2. Unicode width policy

   Decide whether softline remains byte-oriented with documented limitations or
   adopts a width/grapheme dependency.

3. Event-loop-friendly session API

   Split `readline()` into create session, feed input, render, poll, and finish
   operations while keeping the existing blocking API as a facade.

4. Searchable history

   Extend current reverse search with forward search, filtering hooks, and any
   richer search lifecycle API that later callers need.

5. Structured diagnostics

   Preserve `last_error()` and `last_readline_status()` but add richer
   machine-readable detail for advanced callers.
