# Retained-frame resize regression

The standalone C fixture and real tmux cell assertions reproduce the reported
stale status suffix after a settled resize between output writes. The fixture
links only Softline, with no renderer, provider or adjacent checkout dependency.
Its producer acknowledges a FIFO barrier after all 500 partial-line characters
have been emitted. The driver verifies those cells before resizing and releasing
the next write, excluding a resize racing the producer.

The repair is `sl_output_stream_reconcile()`, called on the owner thread after
resize settles and before synchronous output resumes. It observes and repaints
the owned frame without entering/cancelling readline, changing input state,
waiting inside feeds or retaining/replaying transcript bytes. Check its result:
a missing cursor report returns `SL_ERROR_IO`. C receiver/free-function and Lua
methods are equivalent. Consumers must rebuild for ABI 1, one increment from
released v0.10.0's ABI 0; the exposed receiver layout gains a method.

Run the required regressions with the prepared native toolchain and tmux:

```sh
cmake --preset debug
cmake --build --preset debug --target retained_resize_fixture test_reconcile
ctest --test-dir build/debug -R '^(softline_retained_.*|softline_reconcile|softline_feed_latency)$' --output-on-failure --no-tests=error
```

These tests cover partial/complete ASCII producer lines, shrink/growth, custom
prompts, status, early/late drafts, watch/yield controls and all 120 original
producer rows appearing unchanged exactly once. PTY protocol checks cover draft
and cursor, queue, history, readline status, terminal modes, type-ahead before a
cursor reply, split UTF-8/SGR, missing replies, retry and off-TTY forwarding.
The feed-latency gate continues to reject any cursor request inside a feed.

For diagnosis of callers omitting reconciliation, the standalone suite remains:

```sh
cmake -S cmake/retained-resize-tests -B build/retained-resize-tests -G Ninja \
  -DSOFTLINE_RESIZE_FIXTURE="$PWD/build/debug/tests/retained_resize_fixture"
ctest --test-dir build/retained-resize-tests --output-on-failure --no-tests=error
```

This explicitly selected diagnostic suite includes raw, unobserved writes that
still return failure under the documented fallback limitation. Cases are neither
disabled nor inverted with `WILL_FAIL`; repaired cases are required in the main
suite. The `retained-observed` fixture now invokes the production reconciliation
API directly, rather than the experimental readline/cancel step.
Failed cases retain before/after-resize cells, final screen and scrollback under
the printed owned build directory. Successful cases remove their scratch.

## Observations before the fix (9f5ce33)

| Case | Result on the unchanged library |
| --- | --- |
| Retained, partial line, 120x30 to 60x18 | Fails: `* Edited snake.cize reproduction` |
| Retained, complete line, 120x30 to 60x18 | Fails: first patch row contains stale status text |
| Retained, partial line, width-only shrink to 60x30 | Fails: contaminated heading |
| Retained, partial line, height-only shrink to 120x18 | Passes |
| Watch/yield ownership, partial/complete lines, early/late draft controls | Four cases pass |
| Input-owned step before continuation, each of the three failing variants | Three cases pass |

The complete diagnostic inventory is eight passing controls and three genuine
failures. Existing feed-latency, native-resize and tmux producer-resize checks
also passed (3/3); that reproduction commit changed no library source or API.

## Mechanism

`sl_output_stream_write_method` sets `output_write_active` before
`sl_prepare_native_output` reconciles retained geometry. `sl_query_cursor_row`
refuses observations while that flag is set, preserving the zero-wait feed
contract. The fallback in `sl_native_reconcile_rendered_frame` therefore estimates
where retained status/input cells moved. A width shrink can expose stale status
suffixes in subsequent producer rows, even without a simultaneous height change.
This localizes the path; it does not prove one arithmetic expression is the cause.

An experimental control re-enters the existing input owner through `sl_readline`
and cancels that input step before continuing output. All three failing variants
then pass. This establishes an input-owned reconciliation/repaint as a promising
repair path, not a production workaround or proof that a cursor query alone is
sufficient.

The implemented operation follows this owner-thread boundary. An already-open
`sl_output_stream_begin` continues to return `SL_ERROR_INVALID`. Physical resizes
racing a write and terminal-specific Unicode/tab reflow ambiguities retain their
documented limits. CAI's dependency update and adoption of the new call are
separate work outside this repository.

## Verification

The completed repair passed the full native suite (57/57), host/API checks
(24/24), ASan/UBSan (14/14), Lua (16/16), and installed static/shared/both
CMake and pkg-config consumers, including lib64. The installed consumer calls
both forms of the reconciliation API. SONAME is `libsoftline.so.1`; generated
package metadata reports ABI 1. Formatting and diff checks also pass.

Logs are retained under `build/retained-resize-{native,host,asan,lua,consumers}.log`.
Old sanitizer and consumer build caches referenced the retired toolchain root;
only those owned build directories were moved aside before reconfiguration.
No release/tag/publish operation is part of this repair.
